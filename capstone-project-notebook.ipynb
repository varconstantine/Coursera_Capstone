RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API are used to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. Situations where data is not readily available are handled by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. Python and its pandas library are used for data exploration and analysis purposes. Finally, the Folium library is used for the visualization of geospatial data and for a more representative communication of the results and findings that are the final output of this notebook.\n",
